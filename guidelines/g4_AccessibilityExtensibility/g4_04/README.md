# EXTEND-4: Limit exposure of ClassLoader instances
![Author](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-Oracle-blue.svg)


Access to ClassLoader instances allows certain operations that may be undesirable:

- Access to classes that client code would not normally be able to access.
- Retrieve information in the URLs of resources (actually opening the URL is limited with the usual restrictions).
- Assertion status may be turned on and off.
- The instance may be cast to a subclass. ClassLoader subclasses frequently have undesirable methods.
- Guideline [9-8](../../g9_AccessControl/g9_08) explains access checks made on acquiring ClassLoader instances through various Java library methods. Care should be taken when exposing a class loader through the thread context class loader.
