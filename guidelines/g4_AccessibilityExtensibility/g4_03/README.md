# EXTEND-3: Isolate unrelated code
![Author](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-Oracle-blue.svg)


Containers, that is to say code that manages code with a lower level of trust, should isolate unrelated application code. Even otherwise untrusted code is typically given permissions to access its origin, and therefore untrusted code from different origins should be isolated. The Java Plugin, for example, loads unrelated applets into separate class loader instances and runs them in separate thread groups.

Although there may be security checks on direct accesses, there are indirect ways of using the system class loader and thread context class loader. Programs should be written with the expectation that the system class loader is accessible everywhere and the thread context class loader is accessible to all code that can execute on the relevant threads.

Some apparently global objects are actually local to applet or application contexts. Applets loaded from different web sites will have different values returned from, for example, ``java.awt.Frame.getFrames``. Such static methods (and methods on true globals) use information from the current thread and the class loaders of code on the stack to determine which is the current context. This prevents malicious applets from interfering with applets from other sites.

Mutable statics (see Guideline [6-11](../../g6_Mutability/g6_11)) and exceptions are common ways that isolation is inadvertently breached. Mutable statics allow any code to interfere with code that directly or, more likely, indirectly uses them.

Library code can be carefully written such that it is safely usable by less trusted code. Libraries require a level of trust at least equal to the code it is used by in order not to violate the integrity of the client code. Containers should ensure that less trusted code is not able to replace more trusted library code and does not have package-private access. Both restrictions are typically enforced by using a separate class loader instance, the library class loader a parent of the application class loader.
