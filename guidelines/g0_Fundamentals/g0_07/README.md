API documentation should cover security-related information such as required permissions, security-related exceptions, caller sensitivity (see Guidelines [9-8](g9_08) through [9-11](g9_11) for additional on this topic), and any preconditions or postconditions that are relevant to security. Documenting this information in comments for a tool such as JavaDoc can also help to ensure that it is kept up to date.
