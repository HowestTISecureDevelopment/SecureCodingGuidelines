Java is primarily an object-capability language. SecurityManager checks should be considered a last resort. Perform security checks at a few defined points and return an object (a capability) that client code retains so that no further permission checks are required.

Why should you consider SecurityManager checks a last resort? Does this slow down you code drastically? Of course rechecking and rechecking is not very performance friendly but define any check as a last resort?


####Is this the check they are referring?
````java
    FilePermission perm = new FilePermission("/temp/testFile", "read");
    AccessController.checkPermission(perm);
````
