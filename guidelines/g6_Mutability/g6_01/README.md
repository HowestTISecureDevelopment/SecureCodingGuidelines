# MUTABLE-1: Prefer immutability for value types
![Author](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-Oracle-blue.svg)


Making classes immutable prevents the issues associated with mutable objects (described in subsequent guidelines) from arising in client code. Immutable classes should not be subclassable. Further, hiding constructors allows more flexibility in instance creation and caching. This means making the constructor private or default access ("package-private"), or being in a package controlled by the package.access security property. Immutable classes themselves should declare fields final and protect against any mutable inputs and outputs as described in Guideline [6-2](../g6_02). Construction of immutable objects can be made easier by providing builders (cf. Effective Java [6]).
