Callback methods are generally invoked from the system with full permissions. It seems reasonable to expect that malicious code needs to be on the stack in order to perform an operation, but that is not the case. Malicious code may set up objects that bridge the callback to a security checked operation. For instance, a file chooser dialog box that can manipulate the filesystem from user actions, may have events posted from malicious code. Alternatively, malicious code can disguise a file chooser as something benign while redirecting user events.

Callbacks are widespread in object-oriented systems. Examples include the following:

- Static initialization is often done with full privileges
- Application main method
- Applet/Midlet/Servlet lifecycle events
- Runnable.run

This bridging between callback and security-sensitive operations is particularly tricky because it is not easy to spot the bug or to work out where it is.

When implementing callback types, use the technique described in Guideline [9-6](../g9_06) to transfer context.
